        my mother is never happy with how no one in the house can seem to put things at the exact, correct angle it is <span class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown(this)">supposed to be at.</span>

                    “ma, you can’t say that, it’s an actual illness”<br>

                        which confuses me, <br>

                        and also a woman<br>
                        and you should know more than anyone<br>
                        how much words matter

        a genetic disposition for perfection? 
        <br>
        though one might argue that would need a certain amount of ‘perfect’.

        i don’t <span class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown(this)">drive</span> myself to success, just despair.

            at the risk of sounding patronising

        my mother studied accounting and <span class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown(this)">got married</span> soon after,
        <span class="dropdown-content">
            read: stopped dreaming
        </span>
        <br>
        and for the first time in <span class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown(this)">17</span>
        <span class="dropdown-content">
            my age
        </span>
        <br>
        years, 
        <br>
        she is <span class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown(this)">working</span>.
        <span class="dropdown-content">
            and going to art and yoga <span class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown(this)">classes</span>

                    that she pays for with her own money

            and it is all very sweet
        </span>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        as i grow, i realise i am <span class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown(this)">a reflection of her</span>
        <span class="dropdown-content">
            it’s like all the poems say, <br>
            oldest daughter, mirror of mother, yada yada
        </span>
        <br>
        and maybe it’s some subconscious subversion of <span class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown(this)">myself</span>
        <span class="dropdown-content">
            do i agree with the things she <span class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown(this)">says and believes</span>,
            <span class="dropdown-content">
                because im scared of becoming<br>
                someone not <span class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown(this)">entwined</span> with her?
                <span class="dropdown-content">
                    or just, someone who is not hers

            </span>
            <br> 
            or am i MAKING myself do so?<br>
            because i imagine some of the things i think she wants from me
        </span>
        <br>
        you know they say imitation is the sincerest form of <span class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown(this)">flattery</span>
        <span class="dropdown-content">
            i think i’ve ruined her enough<br>
            that flattery has no effect
        </span>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        can you be both a <span class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown(this)">branch</span>
        <span class="dropdown-content">
            splitting off and away<br>
            i want my OWN opinions!<br>
	        my own thoughts!<br>
	        i will be <span class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown(this)">successful</span>
            <span class="dropdown-content">
                out of <span class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown(this)">spite</span>

            <br>

        </span>
        
    
        <br>
        and a <span class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown(this)">root</span>
        <span class="dropdown-content">
            i hope i never leave her<br>

        <br>
        at the same time?
        <br>
        <br>
        
        i might be sabotaging myself. 
        <br>
        i also might be more <span class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown(this)">selfish</span> than i’m coming across.
        <span class="dropdown-content">
            this function is valid if and only if MY successes are a subset of HER regrets

        <br>
        
        we both, i think, strive for perfection. 
        <br>
        maybe her patience 
        <br>
        came with age, 
        <br>
        and my overindulgence in everything that feels wrong
        <br>
        might be <span class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown(this)">either</span> a byproduct of my youth or just the world we live in.
